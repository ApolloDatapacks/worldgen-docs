# Biomes

Biome files contain information about a biome such as the sky/water colors, mob spawning, and features used in generation.

They are stored in the `/worldgen/biome` folder.


Let's take a look at an example biome configuration:
```json

            }

        "water_ambient": [],

    "temperature": 0.8
}
```

There's a lot to configure in biomes. The settings are as follows:

* `carvers`: The configured carvers the biome should use.
    * `air`: (optional) A list of carvers that carve through terrain in the `air` cave generation step. 
    * `liquid`: (optional) A list of carvers that carve through terrain in the `liquid` cave generation step. Unused in vanilla as of 1.18.
* `downfall`: Controls the grass and foliage color if those colors are unset.
* `effects`: The effects in the biome.
    * `additions_sound`: (optional) The additional sound settings.
        * `sound`: The ID for the sound to be used.
        * `tick_change`: The chance per tick for the sound to start being played, as a value between 0 and 1.
    * `ambient_sound`: (optional) The ID for the amount sound to be used.
    * `fog_color`: The fog color in the biome, as a decimal value.
    * `foliage_color`: (optional) The foliage color in the biome, as a decimal value. The downfall and temperature values will determine the foliage color if none is provided.
    * `grass_color`: (optional) The grass color in the biome, as a decimal value. The downfall and temperature values will determine the grass color if none is provided.
    * `grass_color_modifier`: (optional) The grass color modifier to use.
        * If set to `none`, no color modifier will be applied. This is the default.
        * If set to `dark_forest`,
